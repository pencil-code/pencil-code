${PENCIL_HOME}/tests
--------------------

NOTE: The bulk of test setups (run via pc_auto-test) is not located here,
but in the samples/ directory.


This directory contains specific tests, e.g. for reading data from Python
and IDL.

The contract for a Python test:

- It is represented by a file <test_name>.py in some subdirectory of
  ${PENCIL_HOME}/tests/python/ .

- The file is executable and can be run from the ${PENCIL_HOME}/tests/
  directory (i.e. data from ${PENCIL_HOME}/tests/input/ can be accessed
  via './input/...').

- There exists a file <test_name>.ref in the same directory that defines
  the reference data and possibly specifies accuracies.

- When the script is run, it writes a file <test_name>.out in the same
  directory.
