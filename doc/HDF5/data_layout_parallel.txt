Sample layout for a simulation with a grid of [nx,ny,nz] grid points per processor.
There are (px,py,pz) processors along the x, y, and z direction.
The number of ghost layers is set here to NG and is of course variable in reality.
This results in a global grid size of mxgrid=nx*px+2*NG in a monolithic layout.
The group and dataset structure and dimensions would be as follows:

data/
	ax	[mxgrid,mygrid,mzgrid]
	ay	[mxgrid,mygrid,mzgrid]
	az	[mxgrid,mygrid,mzgrid]
	lnTT	[mxgrid,mygrid,mzgrid]
	lnrho	[mxgrid,mygrid,mzgrid]
	ux	[mxgrid,mygrid,mzgrid]
	uy	[mxgrid,mygrid,mzgrid]
	uz	[mxgrid,mygrid,mzgrid]
