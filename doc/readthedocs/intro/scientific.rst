Scientific usage of the Pencil Code
********************************************

A search using ADS (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/)
lists the papers in which the |PC| is being quoted.
In the following we present the papers that are making use of
the code either for their own scientific work of those authors, or
for code comparison purposes.
We include conference proceedings, which make up 15--20\% of all papers.
We classify the references by year and by topic, although the topics are
often overlapping.
The primary application of the |PC| lies in astrophysics,
in which case we classify the papers mostly by the field of research.
Additional applications can also be found in meteorology and combustion.

  Number of papers since 2003 that make use of the |PC|.
  In blue are shown the papers that are not co-authored by Brandenburg, 
  in green the number of papers that reference it for code comparison
  or other purposes, and in red the number of papers that are not yet classified by topic.
  The enhanced number of papers during 2011--2013 results from publications
  related to his ERC Advanced Grant.
