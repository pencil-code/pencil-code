Discussion Topics
=================

Ongoing or pending topics for future meetings.

- Tutorials

- Array order convention: Current array order is [z, y, x]. Consider changing to [x, y, z] (standard convention), but this may break existing scripts.

- Shall we mark obsolete items in :ref:`python-decisions` as obsolete, or remove them entirely?

- Official Pencil Python package.


Feel free to add more — this section is a living to-do list.
If an item you want to discuss is already in the list, please add a ``+1`` to give the item priority according to the number of people interested.
