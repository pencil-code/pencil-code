.. The Pencil Code is primarily designed to deal with weakly compressible turbulent flows,  which is why we use high-order first and second derivatives. To achieve good parallelization, we use explicit (as opposed to compact) finite differences. Typical scientific targets include driven MHD turbulence in a periodic box, convection in a slab with non-periodic upper and lower boundaries, a convective star embedded in a fully nonperiodic box, accretion disc turbulence in the shearing sheet approximation, self-gravity, non-local radiation transfer, dust particle evolution with feedback on the gas, etc. A range of artificial viscosity and diffusion schemes can be invoked to deal with supersonic flows. For direct simulations regular viscosity and diffusion is being used.




Welcome to the documentation for the Pencil Code â€” a high-order finite-difference code for weakly compressible turbulence and beyond.
