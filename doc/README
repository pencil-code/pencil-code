In manual.tex we try to keep a reasonably up-to-date description of the code.
For latex installations that don't have some of the less frequent style files,
we keep a selection in the texinputs/ directory. If you use the makefile to
process manual.tex, you will automatically have that directory included in
your TeX path.

Note that you need to make sure a sufficiently recent version of
index.sty is first in your TEXINPUTS. The Makefile takes care of this.

If you cannot compile the text locally, you can get the
pdf file of the latest version with
   wget http://www.nordita.org/software/pencil-code/doc/manual.pdf

Since 1 Dec 2014, the web pages of the Pencil Code reside on a branch,
so we recommend that in your directory pencil-code/doc you say:

  svn checkout https://pencil-code.googlecode.com/svn/branches/www
