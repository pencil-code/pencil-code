In manual.tex we try to keep a reasonably up-to-date description of the code.
For latex installations that don't have some of the less frequent style files,
we keep a selection in the texinputs/ directory. If you use the makefile to
process manual.tex, you will automatically have that directory included in
your TeX path.

Note that you need to make sure a sufficiently recent version of
index.sty is first in your TEXINPUTS. The Makefile takes care of this.

can lead to problems. As root, edit the file texmf.cnf as follows:
< main_memory = 263000 % words of inimemory available; also applies to inimf&mp
> main_memory = 383999 % words of inimemory available; also applies to inimf&mp

< hash_extra = 0
> hash_extra = 15000

< max_strings = 15000
> max_strings = 30000

< pool_size = 125000
> pool_size = 250000
