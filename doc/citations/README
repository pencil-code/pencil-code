Important note when you add something new:
  New entries to ref.bib imply manual changes to notes.tex and times.txt.
  Then, run ptimes.pro and produce a new ps file (cut+paste).
  The script also gives a summary of data (number of papers, the number
  of papers w/o Brandenburg, and code comparison-type papers, etc.)
