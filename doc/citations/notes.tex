\title{Scientific use of the {\sc Pencil Code}}
\author{Search results using \url{http://adslabs.org}}
\maketitle

A search using \url{http://adslabs.org} indicates the papers where the
{\sc Pencil Code} is being quoted.
In the following we quote the papers that are directly making use of
the code either for their own scientific work of those authors, or
for code comparison purposes.
We include conference proceedings, which make about 15--20\% of all papers.
We classify the references by year and by topic, but the topics are
often overlapping.
The primary application of the {\sc Pencil Code} lies in astrophysics,
in which case we classify mostly by the field of research.

\section{Papers by year}

As of May 2014, the {\sc Pencil Code} has been used for a total of
352 research papers.
