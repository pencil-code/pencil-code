Number of papers since 2003 that make use of the {\sc Pencil Code}.
In red is shown the number of papers that reference it for code comparison
or other purposes and in blue the papers that are not co-authored
by Brandenburg.

A search using ADS \url{https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/}
lists the papers in which the {\sc Pencil Code} is being quoted.
In the following we present the papers that are making use of
the code either for their own scientific work of those authors, or
for code comparison purposes.
We include conference proceedings, which make up 15--20\% of all papers.
We classify the references by year and by topic, although the topics are
often overlapping.
The primary application of the {\sc Pencil Code} lies in astrophysics,
in which case we classify the papers mostly by the field of research.
Additional applications can also be found in meteorology and combustion.
