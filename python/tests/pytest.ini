markers =
    integration: tests that depend on stuff outside the Python module. These require sourceme.sh to have been sourced in the current shell.
    pcautotest: tests that run pc_auto-test. These require sourceme.sh to have been sourced in the current shell. These are a subset of the integration tests.
    xdist_group: used by the pytest-xdist plugin (defined here to allow tests to be performed without pytest-xdist installed)
