This directory contains the python subroutines for postprocessing.
sourceme.sh now resents your $PYTHONPATH to include $PENCIL_HOME/python,
so you can just do

import pencil as pc

in your script or from your favorite python shell (ipython is a good one).

Once you've done so,

  ts = pc.read.ts()

reads the 'time_series.dat' file and

  var = pc.read.var(datadir='data/')

returns an object with the entire f array as well as some handy constants.

Note that because python is C-indexed instead of fortran-indexed, and
matplotlib assumes [y,x] ordering for 2D plotting, the f array returned is in
the opposite order from how it is in pencil: var.f.shape will return
(nvar,nz,ny,nx).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get started with visualizing Pencil-Code data in Python:

1. Install the matplotlib library (a package often called
  python-matplotlib), which should install numpy as a dependency.
1a. You may also want to install ipython.
2. Initialize you PYTHONPATH environment variable by sourcing 'sourceme.*'.
3. Load all of the Python pencil modules using 'import pencil as pc'
4. Load data using 'pc.read_ts()', etc.
