#############################
## DESCRIPTION
##
This python package contains a set of subroutines for postprocessing your Pencil Code data.
Pencil will do all imports and diagnostics on your pencil code data in the best and easiest way possible.
Therefore, 'pc' will store all calcuated data in separate files and reload if necessary.

#############################
## REQUIREMENTS
##
This module requires the followint Python3 modules:
numpy, scipy, matplotlib, h5py, copy, mpi4py, os, sys, math, importlib, dill, struct, subprocess, pickle,
glob, time, re, copy, shutil, code, inspect, vtk, weakref, atexit, unittest, tempfile, errno, pexpect, doctest,
distutils, Cython, random, fileinput, astropy

#############################
## EASY START
##
1. Add $PENCIL_HOME/python to your $PYTHONPATH or enshure this is already done by using 'echo $PYTHONPATH' in your bash shell.

2. Start Python (or better ipython) from your simulation main folder and try:
   import pencil as pc

3. Try to read your time series:

   ts = pc.read.ts()

   this reads in the time_series.dat with all its data. Check out what's available:

   ts.keys

4. Try to read in the latest var.dat file:

  var = pc.read.var()

  Check out what's available again with:

  var.keys

  var should store the latest snapshot (f-array) from the var.dat file including
  some meta information.

5. Try to read in an earlier snapshot. First check which snapshots are available by getting your simulation as an object

   sim = pc.get_sim()

6. Get the varlist:

   vars = sim.get_varlist()
   print(vars)

   then read the second snapshot:

   var_2nd = pcn.read.var(varfile=vars[1])

Now you can investigate further your data.

Note that because python is C-indexed instead of Fortran-indexed, and
matplotlib assumes [y, x] ordering for 2D plotting, the f-array returned is in
the opposite order from how it is in pencil: var.f.shape will return
(nvar, nz, ny, nx).

## WHAT IS WHERE?
##

~ io           input und output functions, like save data or call IDL scripts
~ diag         diagnostic scripts and functions that produce physical meaningfull output
~ visu         visualization routines, here you find also helpers for e.g. exporting figures
~ calc         complex math functions and further calculations and helpers
~ math         basic math functions, like products and derivatives, but also numerical helpers, like is_number
~ sim          handling simulations as python objects and do stuff with simulations objects, like grouping and sorting
~ read         read data and parameters from your pencil code simulation, many of these functions can be accessed directly from simulation objects
~ tool_kit     all nice workarounds get stored here (e.g., resubmit script), but your dirty tools here!
~ export       exporter (e.g., vtk, xml)
~ backpack     third party modules, tribute goes to the authors!
