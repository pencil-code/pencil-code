############### to do list for PC python package #############

1. Store information about array indices in data objects. (SC)
3. Writing (in IO) routines for custom data: (FG, SC, LFSR)
4. Implement particles reding modules for different types of particles. (VC, JA)
6. Simulation objects last implementations (see below). (LFSR, VC)
8. Coordinate transformations, including fields. (JA, SC)
11. Examples in all doc strings. Epydoc usage?


Implement the following IDL routines:
* pc_read_var_time: reads out only the time stamp of an VARX or var.dat
* pc_read_var_raw: reads a varfile efficiently
  Do we need this if we implement already efficient reading routine?
* pc_read_subvol_raw: reads out only part of a var.dat or VARX
* pc_read_slice_raw: reads any 2D-slice from a varfile, wraps around 'pc_read_subvol_raw'
* pc_read_pstalk: reads in stalk files
* quick implementation of IDL routines by calling them using pyIDL OR IDL bridge


Do better reading routines:
* read meta data/header of files at init, e.g. time in VAR or ts header before read()


Use simulation objects to:
* mkdatadir via bash command?


Do better visualizations:
* interactive visualization
* plot routines via typical style files (paper style, ApJ style, Simon style, ...)

Check functions:
*Every file should work independently, even if the environment is not loaded.


############### DONE #############
Use simulation objects to:
* copy simulations (copy-constructor for simulation objects producing new simulations in a new dir)
* manipulate Simulation files: *.in and *.local from python
* compile simulations
* start simulation/submit
* add "resume simulation as new simulation from a certain VARXYZ or var.dat"
* allow execution of bash commands (pc_build, submit, llsubmit, ....) in simulation folder


Put simulations in dictionary to:
* sort them
* group them

November 2020 meeting:
Naming of files differ to functions/classes (Wolfgang - check reload options) 
imports to be inside functions rather than file header (Wolfgang)
Use black to run reformatting on Python ? (Wolfgang)
Add tutorial examples to wiki and also the pencil/tutorials (Simon/Illa)
Duplicate jupyter with python and ipython and update README (Simon)
