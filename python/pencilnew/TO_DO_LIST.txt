############### to do list for PC python package #############

1. Store information about array indices in data objects. (SC)
2. Change to xyz ordering in all routines. (FG)
3. Writing (in IO) routines for custom data: (FG, SC, LFSR)
4. Implement particles reding modules for different types of particles. (VC, JA)
5. Rbox_vid for visualization. (VC, SC).
6. Simulation objects last implementations (see below). (LFSR, VC)
7. Simplify directory structure: calc and diag into toolkit, some into math? Subdivide further. (SC).
8. Coordinate transformations, including fields. (JA, SC)
9. Derivatives on non-equidistant grids. (JA)
10. Tutorials: wait until pencilnew is set up, then update tutorials and decide who is doing stuff.
    Have examples that are specific to simulations.
11. Examples in all doc strings.


Implement the following IDL routines:
* pc_read_var_time: reads out only the time stamp of an VARX or var.dat
* pc_read_var_raw: reads a varfile efficiently
  Do we need this if we implement already efficient reading routine?
* pc_read_subvol_raw: reads out only part of a var.dat or VARX
* pc_read_slice_raw: reads any 2D-slice from a varfile, wraps around 'pc_read_subvol_raw'
* pc_read_pstalk: reads in stalk files
* quick implementation of IDL routines by calling them using pyIDL OR IDL bridge


Do better reading routines:
* read meta data/header of files at init, e.g. time in VAR or ts header before read()


Use simulation objects to:
* mkdatadir via bash command?


Make more efficient:
* vtk exporter with no loops
* use multi core capabilities to spead up processes, e.g. threads or multicore library


Do better visualizations:
* interactive visualization
* plot routines via typical style files (paper style, ApJ style, Simon style, ...)

############### DONE #############
Use simulation objects to:
* copy simulations (copy-constructor for simulation objects producing new simulations in a new dir)
* manipulate Simulation files: *.in and *.local from python
* compile simulations
* start simulation/submit
* add "resume simulation as new simulation from a certain VARXYZ or var.dat"
* allow execution of bash commands (pc_build, submit, llsubmit, ....) in simulation folder


Put simulations in dictionary to:
* sort them 
* group them


############### open issues ###############
- SC: Do we need ogvar and ogdim? Ask JA.
