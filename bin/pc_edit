#  This script is a wrapper for an arbitrary editor $1 working on a file identified by path $2.
#  It checks whether $2 exists in $PENCIL_HOME, and if so, opens the editor with file $PENCIL_HOME/$2.
#  For convenience, one would individually define a shell alias like 
#    alias <short name>='pc_edit <preferred editor>' and then use <short name> <path>.
# 
#  Usage:
#     pc_edit <editor> <path>
#
