Comments:
    1D run with just thermal conduction; the thermal conductivity is a prescribed profile.
    This sample tests reading initial conditions from a stratification.dat file with strati_type='lnrho_ss'
    
    Fails because cs2top, cs2bot are not set in the 'stratification' initial condition.
