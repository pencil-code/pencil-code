Comments:
    MRI-active globaldisk in cartesian coordinates with dust particles.
    When using it for production runs, remember to change format "F" to "E" 
    in the stresses. The initial stresses are too near machine precision to 
    figure in the auto-test, hence the "F" format and the absense of the 
    Maxwell stress brbpm in the print.in of this sample.

History:
    Since revision r8029 of 29-aug-2007, lbidiagonal_derij=T is the
    default; see the manual on page 127 (formerly page 100), see Fig.20
    (former Fig.15). In order to maintain agreement with earlier reference data,
    we used in this sample lbidiagonal_derij=F until 8-aug-10.
Note:
    To simplify the input of in this sample, the specification of
    the input parameters cdt=0.4, cdtv=0.4, dtmin=1e-6 will be dropped
    in the future. The default is cdtv=0.25, so the result would change.
