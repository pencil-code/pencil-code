Comments:
    Use this 1D model to calculate the density and temperatue profile for the 
    initial condition in the 3D supernova driven turbulence models of the ISM,
    that has identical vertical grid and hydrodynamic run parameters.
    An example is given in sample ../HD3D
    Magnetic field and cosmic rays can be added to the 3D model
    
    Convergence typically requires about 1 Gyr depending on the parameters and 
    vertical extent, but in 1D this can be computed in under an hour. 
    The vertical oscillations in the 3D simulations of Gent et al 2012 due to
    the initial vertical pressure imbalance persisted for about 400 Myr, and this
    evidentally persists longer with greater vertical extent, so the preparation
    appears justified.
    
    The averaged SN heating substitutes for the SN driven turbulence and will be
    smoothly superceded by the SN explosions in the 3D model.
    
    To obtain the 1D data file run
    > python ism_save.dat
    from the command line then copy the init_ism.dat file into the new 3D run
    directory
