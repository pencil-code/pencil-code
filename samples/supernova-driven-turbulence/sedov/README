Recommended resolution:
    at least 24x24x24 (A larger box will be required with resolution 4pc)
    for 1 atom per cc a box radius > 150pc is required end time 2 Myr
    for 0.001 atom per cc a box radius > 600pc is required end time 5 Myr
Comments:
    designed to verify the code reproduces the Sedov-Taylor solution for a single
    supernova remnant in a monotomic uniform ISM at rest.                
    if using density < 0.5 atom per cc increase box to keep away from boundary
    injection of 10^51 ergs => 50% kinetic and 50% thermal energy.

    To calculate analytic profiles and plot 1D slices of SN radius and profile speed
    run 
    > python sedov.py
