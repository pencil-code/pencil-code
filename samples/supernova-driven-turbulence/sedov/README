Comments:
    designed to verify the code reproduces the Sedov-Taylor solution for a single
    supernova remnant in a monotomic uniform ISM at rest.                
    if using density < 0.5 atom per cc increase box to keep away from boundary
    injection of 10^51 ergs => 50% kinetic and 50% thermal energy.
