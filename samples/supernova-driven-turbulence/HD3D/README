Use the 1D model (an example is given in sample ../1D_ism_init) to obtain
the file init_ism.dat containing density and temperatue profiles for the 
initial condition in this 3D supernova driven turbulence model of the ISM.
The 1D model has identical vertical grid and hydrodynamic run parameters.
Magnetic field and cosmic rays can be added to this 3D model

The averaged SN heating substitutes for the SN driven turbulence and will be
smoothly superceded by the SN explosions as the turbulence evolves.

SN are spatially distributed according to a uniform distribution in the 
horizontal plane and gaussian distribution vertically centred about the 
centre of mass, which fluctuates near to the midlplane. Default SN frequency
rates are milky way estimates and default mass and gravitional acceleration
are taken from the solar vicinity.
