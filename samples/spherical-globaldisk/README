Comments:
    Planet-disk interaction in three dimensions, in a disk modeled 
    in Spherical coordinates. 
Reference:
    Used in Wlad's thesis, unpublished in literature, but similar to the models presented in 
    de Val-Borro, M. and 22 coauthors (incl. Lyra, W.): 2006, “A comparative study of disc-planet 
    interaction,” Monthly Notices Roy. Astron. Soc. 370, 529-558. 
    For the pointmasses code, this tests the potential 'plummer' for the planet.
