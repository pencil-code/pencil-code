    succeeds since 24-Sep-2002
Recommended resolution:

    currently: 32x32x32 (with nu=eta=3e-3)
Comments:
    This sample presents the decay of a pair of interlocked
    flux rings.  Since the Pencil Code User Meeting 2010, the
    initial condition is no longer in magnetic, but is invoked
    via: INITIAL_CONDITION=initial_condition/fluxrings

History:
    Since revision r8029 of 29-aug-2007, lbidiagonal_derij=T is the
    default; see the manual on page 127 (formerly page 100), see Fig.20
    (former Fig.15). In order to maintain agreement with earlier reference data,
    we used in this sample lbidiagonal_derij=F until 8-aug-10.
Note:
    To simplify the input of in this sample, the specification of
    the input parameters cdt=0.4, cdtv=0.3, will be dropped in the
    future. The default is cdtv=0.25, so the result would change.
