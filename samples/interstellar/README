Status:
    has been working in this form since 21-Jun-2016
    revised 27-Sep-2016
    revised 21-Mar-2018: upwind used to replace cs-dep diffusivities
                         constant low diffusivities can be included, which no
                         longer affect code stability. Stability is now 
                         controlled by shock mass diffusion and shock viscosity
Recommended resolution:
    at least 16x16x1000 (maintain grid resolution <= 0.004 for larger Lx,Ly)
Comments:
    Use the 1D model (an example is given in sample ../1D_ism_init) to obtain
    the file init_ism.dat containing density and temperatue profiles for the 
    initial condition in this 3D supernova driven turbulence model of the ISM.
    The 1D model has identical vertical grid and hydrodynamic run parameters.
    Magnetic field and cosmic rays can be added to this 3D model
    
    The averaged SN heating substitutes for the SN driven turbulence and will be
    smoothly superceded by the SN explosions as the turbulence evolves.
    
    SN are spatially distributed according to a uniform distribution in the 
    horizontal plane and gaussian distribution vertically centred about the 
    centre of mass, which fluctuates near to the midlplane. Default SN frequency
    rates are milky way estimates and default mass and gravitional acceleration
    are taken from the solar vicinity.
    
    To obtain the 1D data file run
    > python ism_save.dat
    from the command line then copy the init_ism.dat file into the new 3D run
    directory
