Comments:
    These sample shows how to use special module meanfield_e_tensor.
    Different subfolders describe different models.

    The module uses parallel HDF5 to load up datasets, so it should be
    compiled with:
    CFLAGS=-I<path to HDF5 installation>/include
    LDFLAGS=-lhdf5_fortran -lhdf5hl_fortran -L<path to HDF5 installation>/lib

    Tensors for the models are created with create_emftensors.py. It uses
    python modules:
    numpy
    scipy
    h5py

    A typical workflow using the special module is as follows:
    1) setup src with pc_setupsrc and build
    2) run pc_start to create grid for create_emftensors.py
    3) run python create_emftensors.py <pencil directory> to create initial tensors
    4) run the simulation

    The input tensors are loaded during runtime, so they can be swapped and 
    modified between runs and resets.
