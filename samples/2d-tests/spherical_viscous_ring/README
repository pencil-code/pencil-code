Added as test Frederic Masset's setup

  "2D 1/2 thick off-centered Keplerian viscous ring spread"

This should test the viscous stress tensor in spherical coordinates. The
description is

"This test follows the evolution of a thick viscous ring in a potential with
axial symmetry around the z-axis. The potential is Keplerian in the distance to
the axis, and harmonic in  z with a minimum at z=1. The gas sound speed is
uniform, therefore the ``disk'' (or ring) thickness is uniform and constant, and
its equatorial plane is located at z=1, as shown in the left plot. This test is
not performed in cylindrical coordinates as it would be natural, but rather in
spherical coordinates. The idea is that if any term of the viscous stress tensor
was wrong, this would appear straight away in the test. The right plot shows the
density in the z=1 plane at different dates, compared against the theoretical
expectations."
