Recommended resolution:
    None. Varying the resolution is a good test of how many grid points the
    code needs to resolve a self-gravitating shear wave.
Comments:
    Linear test problem for gas self-gravity in the shearing sheet. A leading
    shear wave is swung around by the Keplerian shear and amplified by
    self-gravity.  One can compare the numerical solution to the result of a
    numerical integration of the linearised equation system, produced by the
    IDL script shear_wave.pro (in the idl/ directory).
