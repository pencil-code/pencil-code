Status:
    Running fails (out of bounds array access) on master
    Works fine on a branch of mine that does not include the changes from gputestv6
Comments:
    Modified samples/conv-slab to test the power_xy subroutine.
    Reference data are from a version of the code before the gputestv6 merger.
