Recommended resolution:
    Any. This is a pure particle run
Comments:

    Simple n-body run with the Sun and the eight (yes, eight!) planets. 
    This sample tests:

      1. The parallel communication of N-body particles, which is 
         slightly different than the dust

      2. The cylindrical correction terms to the movement of 
         lagrangian particles 

      3. The "out" boundary condition whence the particles are 
         allowed to be out of grid
