Comments:
    In this test we solve the energy, density and species equations.
    The mixture is initially set to a temperature above the ignition
    temperature, and we follow the ignintion of the mixture.
    Since the required timestep is not straight forward to determine
    when chemical reactions are involved we use the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg
    method for the timestepping.
